Try these:
- [ctrl]+[v] (RStudio) for VISUAL BLOCK mode 
- [shift]+[v] to select a whole line
- [:sort⮐] to sort lines
- [:sort u⮐] to remove duplicates
- [o] in visual mode to jump between beginning/end of selection (e.g. to extend)

Tips:
- replace (regex) all tabs for bars: `:%s/\t/ | /%g`
- visual block mode with "[ctrl]+[v]" (or "[ctrl]+[q]" in vim)
- `:norm I0`, `:norm vi(ohol` (does not work well in RStudio)
- [.] to repeat
- macros:
    [q]+register, e.g. [q1],
    followed by some keystrokes
    [q] to end recording
    [@]+register to apply, remember counters: [3@1]


# adjusting a markdown list of images

Imagine you have a list of image filenames from your "figures" subfolder.
How to get them to the syntax `![alt text](path/to/image.png "Title")`?

(will do this in `:!rstudio.exe %`)
Advanced Tip:
- send files to unix commands, e.g. `:!cat % | wc -l`


# honorary mention: registers

using `:reg`

- quite powerful
- stores what you yank
- used for macros

the `+` register is what interacts with the clipboard

- setting connection to clipboard is tricky
- in rstudio, you have [y] and [ctrl]+[c]
