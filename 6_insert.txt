> Chapter 2: Editing / Insert Mode


Navigation is just the first step.
But you haven't written a single letter, yet!

There are many options to adjust text with vim.
We will also repeat some concepts from before.

INSERT MODE:
You can enter insert mode with [i],
and leave it with [Esc] (i.e. the Escape key)
[Esc] always brings you back to Normal Mode.

<< try writing something here in insert mode.


Your safety belt: you can always [u] to Undo; and [Ctrl]+[r] to redo.
> Insert extra characters to this sentence. Then undo it.


There are many more options to enter insert mode, vim is case sensitive:
Try to find out for yourself what [A], [a] ("append"), and [I] do.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
> sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
> Ut enim ad minim veniam,
> quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip
> ex ea commodo consequat.


Another field of options: CHANGE [c]

Try to change the word "word" by typing [cw], for "change word".
> change this word


Remember that you can change three words with [3cw]
> Change will come!
What would be the difference between [3cw] and [3cW]?
> Word-change will come!


You can change a whole rest of a line with [c$], same as [C]
> Change will happen to all of us eventually.


Change a whole line with [cc].
> Embrace Change [c]! Sometimes, it makes sense to [cc] and start from scratch.


Now one of my favorites.
[ci] "CHANGE IN":
    change everything in brackets with [ci(],
    or change in quotes with [ci"] or [ci'],
    remember to undo with [u] to try again.
> message("We have to change messages 'in quotes' sometimes.")
> sprintf("Sometimes even %s is not enough.", "that")


If you want to delete a word, you could do [cw]+[Esc].
Or just use [d], for DELETE!
You guess it, you try it:
> Delete an godverdorie unwanted word with [dw].
> Deeeelete three letters at once with [3dl].
> SssShorthand: you could also use [3x].


Change the first "i" to a "e" by typing [fire].
> Do you agree that iverybody shoult try vim.

Note: [r] will REPLACE a single letter. Or five [5r].


IMPORTANT: letters or words you delete
    are automatically stored in "registers" (something like the clipboard).
Task:
1. Delete the invasive species ("Vespa") with [df,].
2. Paste it to the list of invasive species with [P] or [p] (difference: paste before/after the cursor).
3. Bonus: capitalize genera with [gUw]; move and REPEAT your last action with the dot [.].

> Vespa velutina nigrithorax, Athene noctua, Solanum tuberosum, Rattus norvegicus, Rutilus rutilus
> Eriocheir sinensis, Fallopia japonica, Procyon lotor


You can apply this to whole sentences: try [dd], then [p]. Useful!
> Go to work.
> Get up in the morning.


Application: what would you do to quickly switch letters? Correct the sentence!
> fI you cacidentally wsitched eltters, sue [???].


Of course, you can copy without deletion - we call that YANKING [y].
> Copy these two lines with [3yy].
> Paste them repeatedly above with [2P].
> Press [.] twice more.

> Delete the whole block with [d{].
> And undo the deletion with [u].

Good to know:
- [C] and [Y] will change/yank the rest of the line, from the cursor.



Are you beginning to see the power of vim?
We haven't even scratched the surface :)
